### Added

## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to latest

1. **Virtual Folder Paths**: If you have custom virtual folder configurations, ensure paths are under `/data/` (e.g., `/data/received`, `/data/send`)

2. **Allowed Files Patterns**: The `*` wildcard now works correctly. Patterns like `*.txt` or `*` are supported.

3. **Cluster Redeployment**: After upgrading, perform a force redeploy to apply the new JGroups configuration:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/clusters/{id}/deploy?force=true
   ```

4. **Version Verification**: Check logs at startup for version banner:
   ```
